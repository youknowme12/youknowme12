- 👋 Hi, I’m Ayushi Jyoti
- 👀 I’m a budding developer and an enthusiastic coder. I love problem solving. Although I code in c++ and java, programming language is never a problem. If needed, I can learn different language for project. I am a quick learner.
- I have also completed a 6-month internship at OYO Rooms as a SDE Intern. Here I explored and learned a variety of skills and tools used in software development like Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Github, Linux, JIRA etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning react.js, in past, i learnt C++, DSA, HTML, Css, Javascript, Php and MySQL.
